# React ToDo App

The feature I have Implemented listed below:

- I have used react verson 18.2.0 and Material ui library.
- Basically a form is implemented logically for adding or editing a specific task
- user can add a task with name and priority and by default with status incomplete  
- user can change the status by clicking on switch 
- user can edit an existing task and delete too
- localstorage is used for storing data
- filtering is done for priority basis of the tasks and counter is added for all tasks and completed tasks
